<p>A decade ago, you could count the number of men’s style bloggers on one hand. Clearly those days are long gone. Today, sifting through all of them would take an eternity. So we’ve gathered 10 that inspire us so you can bookmark them and get inspired too.</p>

<h2>1. Whiskey Grade</h2>



<p><a href="http://whiskeygrade.com/category/menswear/" target="_Blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Whiskey Grade</a>&nbsp;has an eye for stylish pieces that possess just a hint of ruggedness. It’s a combination of modern fashion and old-school good looks. You’ll find jackets, denim, and leather goods that last a lifetime, with more than a few motorcycles littered throughout the site.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://coolmaterial.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/well-spent-logo.jpg" alt=""/></figure>

<h2>2. Well Spent</h2>



<p>Brad Bennett has showcased his eye for quality since he started the site in 2011. Instead of crazy runway pieces, you’ll get a dose of simple, well-made staples that won’t leave your bank account empty. Scan through the archives for a slew of American-made goods, which feature an emphasis on craftsmanship.<a href="http://well-spent.com/" target="_Blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Well Spent</a></p>

<h2>3. Valet.</h2>



<p><a href="http://www.valetmag.com/" target="_Blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Valet.</a>&nbsp;has been curating and creating great style content for the better part of a decade. Packed into the site are features that cover everything from sales and deals to buying guides for specific garments. Despite new posts on a daily basis–and a slew of nooks and crannies to the site–everything is clean and organized.</p>

<h2>4. Style Girlfriend</h2>



<p>Not surprisingly, most men’s style blogs are written by … wait for it … men. While that’s great, it’s nice to have a female’s perspective. Few dish out better advice than Megan Collins and her site&nbsp;<a href="http://www.stylegirlfriend.com/" target="_Blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Style Girlfriend.</a>&nbsp;The clothing picks and articles cover everything from athletic gear to dress shirts and suits. Of course, as the site says, style is about more than just clothes, so expect to find posts on fitness, barware and travel too.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://coolmaterial.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/four-pins.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<h2>5. Four Pins</h2>



<p>Rarely is fashion writing as entertaining as it is on&nbsp;<a href="http://four-pins.com/" target="_Blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Four Pins.</a>&nbsp;Meshing street style with a sense of humor, the site not only shares new apparel and covers interesting topics, but it does so without leaving you asleep at the keyboard.</p>

<h2>6. A Continuous Lean</h2>



<p>Michael Williams keeps quality at the forefront of everything he posts. There’s a heritage feel to almost every story and a celebration of all things Americana. If you’re looking to see what brands like Red Wing and Filson are up to, it’s one of the best places to start.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.acontinuouslean.com/" target="_Blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A Continuous Lean.</a></p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://coolmaterial.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/highsnob.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<h2>7. Highsnobiety</h2>



<p>The guys over at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.highsnobiety.com/" target="_Blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highsnobiety</a>&nbsp;have their finger on the pulse of the future. Whereas many style blogs focus on classic pieces you’ll hold onto forever, Highsnobiety pushes the conversation forward with the latest sneakers, trends and even art.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://coolmaterial.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/dappered.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<h2>8. Dappered</h2>



<p>Affordability is not a common theme in many men’s style magazines. The latest heritage fit blazer is great, but if it costs $1,000, how many guys are really considering it?&nbsp;<a href="https://coolmaterial.com/style/wear-this-dappered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dappered</a>&nbsp;turns its attention to stylish pieces you could actually afford.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://coolmaterial.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/aheadlongdive.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<h2>9. A Headlong Dive</h2>



<p>Sometimes you don’t want to get bogged down in copy when you’re looking for new garb to buy.&nbsp;<a href="http://aheadlongdive.com/" target="_Blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A Headlong Dive</a>&nbsp;does a tremendous job of letting the clothes do the talking. It’s easy to mindlessly peruse until you find a piece you want to add to your wardrobe.</p>

<h2>10. Scout Sixteen</h2>



<p>There are a ton of sites that only feature the author wearing a different outfit every few weeks. While many of these offer little in the way of content you can really sink your teeth into, Justin Livingston of&nbsp;<a href="http://scoutsixteen.com/" target="_Blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scout Sixteen</a>&nbsp;combines the idea with informative articles for a more polished feel.</p>
